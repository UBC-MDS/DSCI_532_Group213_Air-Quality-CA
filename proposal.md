## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose


## Section 2: Description of the data
We will be visualizing a data set of the number of deaths by risk factors of 196 countries from 1990 to 2017. The data has 6468 rows and 30 columns including the `country name`, `country code`, `year` and factors (e.g. `Unsafe water source (deaths)`, `Low birth weight (deaths)`, `Smoking (deaths)`, `High blood pressure (deaths)`, `Obesity (deaths)`, `Air pollution (outdoor & indoor) (deaths)` etc). 

(The data has been approved by Firas. The data was published by "Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network. Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 (GBD 2017) Results. Seattle, United States: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), 2018". It could be downloaded [here](https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution).)
