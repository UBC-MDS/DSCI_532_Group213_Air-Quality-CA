### Reflection


This application visualizes the global risk factors that contribute to human death and has well-designed features that provide answers to the research questions outlined in milestone 1 of this project. The app does so well in showing the top risk factors that contribute to global death and those that contribute to the least deaths. It also interactively shows in a choropleth in a geographic distribution on the percentage of death caused by each risk factor in every country in the world. Moreover, the app is so interactive that it allows the users to easily visualize the global death trends for various risk factors from 1990 up to 2017 using interactive features such as dropdown menus, radio buttons, etc.
Based on the feedback we received from TAs and reviews from our peers, we have incorporated several changes into our milestone 2 python project. These include code cleaning and refactoring, code reformating using PEP8 style and directory re-organization. We have also added more in-line comments and reduced the length of the app functionality description for the homepage of our app. We also modified the titles of our interactive charts to fully reflect our research questions. 

We also did layout modifications such as alignment of chart headings and relocating the radio buttons and normalizing the trends (third panel) into a percentage for the population in each continent. This is to allow users to avoid scrolling down to make selections for the risk factors.
Unfortunately, there were few suggestions from peers that we couldn't incorporate at this time since they conflicted with our research questions. For instance,  including all the risk factors into our charts, but only the top five are required by our research question 1. We also decided to stick to the year 2017 for our charts as required by our research questions 2 and 3 of our project.

Furthermore, since the development team was limited on time, this app has several limitations. First of all, adding a jumbotron button and manipulating the dash fonts and colours was uneasy. Our overview bar chart is currently for 2017 only as indicated in our research question, but doesn't have a range slider that allows the user to pick a year of interest.
Hence, several future improvements could be made such as having a range slider to allow users to choose the range of years they would like to see the overview of deaths caused by the various risk factors. Furthermore, the geo map could also have an additional feature that generates a summary graph after the user highlights a group of countries. This would allow comparison among countries of interest. Another improvement is the need to have an additional slider for choosing a particular year for the Trend chart along with the radio buttons for risk factors that are currently implemented.

Overall, the feedback we received from TAs and peers on our milestone2 has also been incorporated where applicable and time permitted. Now, We have redeployed the dashboard application in a manner that fully reflects the received feedback and is aligned with the functionalities promised in our research questions.
